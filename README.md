#  Audio information
Vincent is Tim Burton's 6-minute stop-motion short film made in 1982. It is black and white, references the German expressionism of the 1920s and makes many references to Price's movies.
"Burton got Vincent Price — an actor known for various horror movies — to narrate his poem"(Sturdevant & Herald, 2012). 
The film tells Vincent's story, who dreams about being the people he admires - Vincent Price and Edgar Allan Poe.
